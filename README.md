# Machine-learning-face-classification-and-auto-completion
This program performs the following tasks:
<br/> 1. Face pictures binary classification using a linear model trained by minimising the L2-regularised sum of squares loss through zeroing the loss gradient.
<br/> 2. Multi-class classification using a linear model
<br/> 3. Face-completion using a linear model (Regress Task).
<br/> 4. Rather than set sum-of-squares-error-loss gradient to 0. Use gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent to train the linear model.
